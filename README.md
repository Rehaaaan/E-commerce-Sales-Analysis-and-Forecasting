<img src="" />
## Objective
To analyze historical e-commerce sales data to identify trends and seasonality, create visualizations, and forecast future sales to assist in strategic planning and inventory management.

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, Prophet)
- Excel
- Tableau

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Data Collection
1. Download the "Online Retail" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. Load the dataset into your data analysis environment.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
1. Inspect the dataset for any missing or duplicate values.
2. Remove duplicates and handle null values appropriately.
3. Convert date columns to the proper datetime format.

### Step 3: Data Aggregation Using SQL
1. Set up a SQL database (using SQLite for simplicity).
2. Aggregate sales data by month, product category, and country using SQL queries to identify trends.

### Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Perform EDA to identify trends, seasonality, and outliers.
2. Use Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data visualization.

### Step 5: Data Visualization
1. Create visualizations in Excel to showcase sales performance.
2. Use Tableau to create interactive dashboards showing sales trends, top product categories, and sales by country.

### Step 6: Sales Forecasting
1. Use ARIMA and Prophet models to forecast future sales.
2. Visualize the forecast results to aid in strategic planning and inventory management.

### Step 7: Business Intelligence Report
1. Generate a comprehensive business intelligence report using Tableau or Power BI.
2. Include key insights, actionable recommendations, and visualizations in the report.

### Step 8: Final Review and Presentation
1. Review all visualizations and reports for accuracy and clarity.
2. Prepare a presentation summarizing the project, methodology, and findings.

### Step 9: Deployment and Sharing
1. Publish Tableau dashboards to Tableau Public or your organizationâ€™s Tableau server.
2. Share Excel visualizations and Power BI reports with stakeholders.

## Project Deliverables
1. Cleaned and aggregated dataset.
2. EDA visualizations.
3. Forecasting models and visualizations.
4. Business intelligence report with key insights and recommendations.
5. Interactive Tableau dashboards.
